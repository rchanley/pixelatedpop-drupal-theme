pixelatedpop-drupal-theme
=========================

Drupal theme used on pixelatedpop.com. It's based on the Zen starter theme ( http://drupal.org/project/zen ).  I'll be the first to say that this thing isn't too elegant, but it's a start.

This is mainly here so it can be under source control and also to allow people that are much better with CSS than me to take a look and potentially contribute.

Feel free to use this theme as a starter for your own Drupal setup, but don't use our name or logo anywhere.  On second thought, you're probably just better off building your own Zen theme.  This one needs to be updated to work with Zen 7.5 that is more mobile-first.
